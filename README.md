# DeepLearning
Project MSDS/3A at ENSAE for the course : "Deep Learning: Models and Optimization" taught by Marco Cuturi.
This project was done in collaboration with Nicolas Tilquin, using Google Colaboratory to take advantage of GPU computations performances. 

On this Github repository, we provide the main Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) and its .html version. Helpers functions used in the notebook are also provided in .py files. Python libraries required to run the code are specified in the .txt file. The complete project is available at : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YJPnH4YziVWUw-lO01_0WjjY_G7FSwvT?usp=sharing
