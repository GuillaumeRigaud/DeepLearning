# DeepLearning
Project MSDS/3A at Ensae for the course : "Deep Learning: Models and Optimization" taught by Marco Cuturi.
This project was done in collaboration with Nicolas Tuilquin, using Google Colaboratory to take advantage of GPU computations performances. 

On this Github repository, we provide the main Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) and its .html version. Helpers functions used in the notebook are also provided in .py files.
